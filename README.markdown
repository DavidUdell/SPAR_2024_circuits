Work for SPAR 2024, Circuit Phenomenology Using Sparse Autoencoders 

## Contents
The `/LaTeX` directory contains the LaTeX source code for our preprint draft.

The `/src` directory contains our two implementations of the unsupervised
circuit discovery algorithm, as git submodules. In the `/feature-circuits`
submodule, work is ongoing in the `jvp-fix` branch specifically.

## Project Status
As of September 2024, work is ongoing (post SPAR Summer 2024), with David
Udell, Jackson Kaunismaa, and Hardik Bhatnagar. We are currently tuning
graphing hyperparameters and collecting data.
